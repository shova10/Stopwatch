üìÅ Project Structure

üì¶ stopwatch/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Main structure of the stopwatch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css      # Styling for layout and buttons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js       # JavaScript logic for time tracking

üöÄ How to Run

    Clone or download the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stopwatch.git

    Open index.html in your browser:

        Double-click it

        Or right-click > Open with > your browser of choice

    No server, build process, or dependencies needed‚Äîjust plug and play!

üß† How It Works

    HTML provides the stopwatch layout (title, display, buttons)

    CSS styles the interface to be clean and centered

    JavaScript handles:

        Start: Begins counting in milliseconds

        Stop: Pauses the timer

        Reset: Resets the display to 00:00:00

Time Calculation Logic:

    Uses setInterval() to update time every millisecond

    Converts time difference to hours, minutes, and seconds

    Pads with leading zeros for consistency

üìå Possible Improvements

    Add lap functionality

    Enable keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Space to start/stop)

    Store elapsed time using localStorage

    Add milliseconds to the display

    Make it mobile-responsive

‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This stopwatch does not persist time after refresh. For persistent or background stopwatch functionality, extra logic would be needed.
